# bus-mall
this is for BusMall a new magazine for buses like SkyMall but for buses. I have it so that you vote 25 times on three random images. The images will not be the same as eachother or the round previous. There is a chart at the end that populates with views and votes for the items looked at. A vote is generated by a user clicking on an image. Views are generated by an image apearing on the screen.
